      <h4 class="alert-heading">Urgent and Distressing Notice</h4>
      <p>I'm really scared right now. This whole situation feels overwhelming and terrifying. They’ve given me a 24-hour notice, which means they could show up tomorrow, on Saturday. This timing seems to be specifically chosen to make things as difficult as possible. I feel like they’re trying to scare me, and it’s working. I’m anxious and frightened, and it feels like they’ve managed to get me exactly where they want me.</p>
      <p>What worries me most is that they could come with authorities or someone in power to enforce this, and I’m not sure what to do. I’ve been documenting everything, and I’m going to make sure it’s online so it can’t be erased or ignored. But the fear of what might happen tomorrow is consuming me. They’ve set this up so that they can act with minimal notice and maximum disruption.</p>
      <p>It feels like my status as a veteran is being disregarded and my entire sense of security is being shattered. Ronald Reagan once said, “All veterans give their lives; some give it up right away, and some pay for it on the installment plan for the rest of their lives. But we all lose it.” Right now, I’m feeling that loss intensely. They’ve managed to push me into a place where I feel like I’m not in control, and every step I take feels like it’s being scrutinized.</p>
      <p>It’s hard for others to understand what I’m going through because they haven’t lived through this kind of fear and uncertainty. My day has been a blur of anxiety and dread, and I’ve been sleeping excessively just to escape it. They’ve set up this situation to leave me feeling powerless, and I’m not sure how to respond when they show up tomorrow. I have a sinking feeling that they’ll come with authority and a pre-prepared narrative. I plan to comply with whatever the police tell me to do, but the fear of what might happen is overwhelming.</p>
      <p>I’m afraid that they’ll come in and put me in an even worse situation, and I won’t be able to reach anyone for help. I’m going to stay inside my home and do my best to follow any instructions, but I’m very scared about the outcome. They’re not sending weak or easy-to-handle people; they’re sending the ones who are going to come down hard. I just want to find a way to handle this situation without it escalating further.</p>
